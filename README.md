# Pong Game

This is a simple Pong game implemented using Python's `turtle` module. The game can be played by two players, each controlling a paddle, and the goal is to score points by getting the ball past the opponent's paddle.

## How to Play
- Player A (left paddle):
  - `W` key: Move paddle up
  - `S` key: Move paddle down
- Player B (right paddle):
  - `Up` arrow: Move paddle up
  - `Down` arrow: Move paddle down
- The goal is to score by hitting the ball past the opponent's paddle. The first player to get the ball past the opponent scores a point.

## Game Features
- Two-player Pong game.
- Basic collision detection for paddles and ball.
- Score tracking for both players.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the `pong_game.py` file.
3. Two players can use the keyboard to control their paddles and try to score points.

## Suggested Improvements
Here are some ideas to extend the game:
1. **Add AI**: Implement a computer-controlled opponent instead of player B.
2. **Speed Variation**: Increase the speed of the ball after each bounce to make the game more challenging.
3. **Game Over Screen**: Display a game-over screen once a player reaches a certain score (e.g., first to 10 points).
4. **Sound Effects**: Add sound effects for paddle hits, ball bounces, and scoring.
5. **Customization Options**: Allow players to customize paddle colors, ball speed, and window size.
6. **Single Player Mode**: Add a single-player mode where the player competes against an AI opponent.
